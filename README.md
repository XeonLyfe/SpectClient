# SpectClient
SpectClient is a client that runs on Minecraft Forge 1.12.2, it is intended for use on servers which allow client-side modification. SpectClient takes inpiration from many previous clients like osiris, kami, salHack, and others. This client uses a custom event system, a custom clickGui library, and Forge's 1.12.2 mod api. My intent is  for this project to be community driven and as open as possible, open access, open development, and open sourced.
